Build WL into one single docker image. (will split up later).

* Get arangodb installed & running
* Get the API talking to ArangoDB

_Alt route, starte with arango db docker image, install node and nginx over the top_

Tidy up the API server.

Deploy without https.

WE SHOULD BE RUNNING!

Next up - build the docker image through a service with incremental versioning (semantic)

Next - look at the user system - can it be built as a seperate service and handle auth checking?

Next - golden layout UI? - create an editing mode of WL with that screen thing? For each service :P
